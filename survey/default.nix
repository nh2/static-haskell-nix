      # See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool/2006-12/msg00047.html

      #   https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage/commit/57a989a2e23c9e46501da1227f371da59d212ae4
      # However, so far, `-all-static` seems to have the same effect
      # of convincing libtool to NOT drop the `-static` flag.
      # Other places where this was dicussed (in case you have to debug this in
      # the future) are:
      #   https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=11064
      #   https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/632
      # Another common thing that people do is to pass `-static --static`,
      # with the intent that `--static` isn't eaten by libtool but still
      # accepted by e.g. gcc. In our case as of writing (nixpkgs commit bc94dcf50),
      # this isn't enough. That is because:
      #   * The `--with-*=/path` options given to curl's `./configure`
      #     are usually `.lib` split outputs that contain only headers and
      #     pkg-config `.pc` files. OK so far.
      #   * For some of these, e.g. for libssh2, curl's `./configure` turns them
      #     into `LDFLAGS=-L/...libssh2-dev/lib`, which doesn't do anything to
      #     libtool, gcc or ld, because `*-dev/lib` contains only `lib/pkgconfig`
      #     and no libraries.
      #   * But for others, e.g. for libnghttp2, curl's `./configure` resolves
      #     them by taking the actual `-L` flags out of the `.pc` file, and turns
      #     them into e.g. `LDFLAGS=-L/...nghttp2-lib/lib`, which contains
      #     `{ *.la, *.a, *.so }`.
      #   * When libtool is invoked with such `LDFLAGS`, it adds two entries to
      #     `./lib/libcurl.la`'s `dependency_libs=`: `-L/...nghttp2-lib/lib` and
      #     `/...nghttp2-lib/lib/*.la`.
      #     When the `.la` path is given, libtool will read it, and pass the
      #     `.so` file referred to within as a positional argument to e.g. gcc,
      #     even when linking statically, which will result in linker error
      #         ld: attempted static link of dynamic object `/...-nghttp2-lib/lib/libnghttp2.so'
